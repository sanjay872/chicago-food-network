# Description
In our app we can login with our google account as a Donor or a receiver. The donors have an option to pick the type of food. The receivers can sort according to donors near their location. 
The locations of donors can be viewed as pins in a minimap. 
The Receivers and donors have a chat window option where they can figure out how the food will get to the person.
